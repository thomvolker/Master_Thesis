# Introduction

As of today, many methods for aggregating scientific evidence have been proposed. Examples are, but are not limited to, conventional (study-level) meta-analysis, individual-level meta-analysis and Bayesian updating. The advantages of such methods are numerous: (i) they enable researchers to establish effects over different studies, (ii) 

As of today, many methods for aggregating scientific evidence have been proposed. Two well-known examples are meta-analysis and Bayesian sequantial updating. Both methods aim at combining the multiple sources of evidence, either from multiple studies, or from collecting additional data.

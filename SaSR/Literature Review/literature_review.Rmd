# Key words

- Dyadic + network embeddedness (focus on network embeddedness for thesis itself).
- Use of own (readily available) data
- Try to align the M&S project and SaSR project as much as possible.
- Endogenous + exogenous (might not be fruitful in the thesis itself).
- Note that the two theses are written in parallel, and have to be finished in May 2022.

# Introduction

Explain the effects of embeddedness

- Why is cooperation often not possible in isolated encounters?
- This can be (partly) overcome by embeddedness.

- Extensively discuss control
- Briefly discuss learning (so that we can refer to the fact that disentangling control and learning might not be always possible).

# Control dyadic embeddedness

## Control in exogenously dyadically embedded interactions (repeated games)

- Dal Bo & Frechette
- Buskens, Raub & Van der Veer

## Control in endogenously dyadically embedded interactions (repeated games)

- Sokolova, Buskens & Raub

# Control network embeddedness

## Control in exogenously embedded interactions in networks

## Control in endogenously embedded interactions in networks

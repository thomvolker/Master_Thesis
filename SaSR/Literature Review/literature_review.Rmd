# Introduction

Social dilemmas are at the core of everyday life. Students may anticipate a good grade for group work with minimal effort by free-riding on the work of their peers, researchers could obtain another publication by letting their collaborators do the lion's share of the required work [@corten_buskens_cooperation_2020] and a car dealer may maximize the returns of a transaction by hiding several vehicle defects when selling a second-hand car to a relatively uninformed customer [@buskens_weesie_experiment_2000]. In these situations, for all individuals involved it would be rational to behave opportunistically. However, the rational decision to behave opportunistically would yield lower collective returns than what could have been achieved under mutual cooperation: hence the term "social dilemma" [@ostrom_behavioral_1998; @kollock_social_1998]. Under the assumption of "social isolation", that is, the interacting actors can be considered perfect strangers that do not anticipate any future interactions, actors can maximize their individual returns by behaving uncooperatively.

Theoretically, it is well established that in isolated social dilemmas, it is generally hard to initiate a cooperative relationship [e.g., see @luce_raiffa_games_1989 for the Prisoner's Dilemma; and @buskens_raub_embedded_2002 for the Trust Game]. Consider for example the standard one-shot Prisoner's dilemma. Regardless of the choice of one's partner, an individual actor obtains the highest payoff by acting opportunistically. Defecting, rather than cooperating, when the other player cooperates leads to a higher payoff, similarly to defecting when the other player defects as well. Hence, the Nash equilibrium is mutual defection, even though both players would be better off with mutual cooperation. Contrary to these ominous theoretical findings, in practice researchers generally find non-negligible rates of cooperation in one-shot games [e.g., see @hayashi_etal_reciprocity_1999; @cooper_et_al_cooperation_1996; @snijders_keren_trust_2001], although these cooperation rates tend to decline when participants gain experience with these games [@dal_b√≥_cooperation_2005].

Multiple scholars, however, noted that most real-life interactions do not take place in social isolation, but are actually embedded [e.g., @axelrod_cooperation_1984; @granovetter_economic_1985]. Embeddedness refers to the fact that the actors involved share a common environment that could foster cooperation [e.g., @buskens_raub_embedded_2002; @yamagishi_yamagishi_trust_1994]. These actors may have interacted in the past, and/or speculate on interacting in the future, which is referred to as *dyadic embeddedness* [@buskens_raub_embedded_2002]. Additionally, the actors may be connected indirectly, through third parties that have interacted with any of the two in the past, or speculate on doing so in the future, which is referred to as *network embeddedness* [@buskens_raub_embedded_2002]. Obviously, actors can be embedded both dyadically and in a network at the same time. Both forms of embeddedness potentially affect cooperative behaviour in social dilemmas substantially. 

In the subsequent sections of this literature review, it will be outlined how embeddedness can affect trust, and cooperative behaviour in general, with a specific focus on control effects through network embeddedness from a game-theoretic perspective.[**IS IT TOO EARLY TO MENTION CONTROL HERE?**] Notably, game-theoretic assumptions yield that actors maximize their utilities. Yet, in research settings, it is often complicated to infer the utilities of the participants at hand, as it is not explicit how they value potential payoffs as specified in the study at hand. Generally, researchers try to overcome this problem by incentivizing the behaviour of participants by offering monetary rewards in the form of points that are translated into money at the end of the experiment. The amount of points one earns depend on the behaviour of oneself, as well as on the behaviour of the others one plays the game with. Although these monetary payoffs do not diminish the possibility that subjects may strive for non-materialistic goals, it is assumed throughout that incentivizing the payoffs allows to interpret the payoffs as the actors' utilities. Furthermore, the empirical findings discussed in this review generally relied on $2$-person Prisoner's Dilemma games or Trust Games. That is, in general, experiments will be considered in which the behaviour of an actor only affects oneself, as well as the single actor toward whom this behaviour is directed. When occasionally another type of game of an $N$-person game (i.e., a game in which the behaviour of an actor is directed toward more than one others) is discussed, this will be explicitly addressed. This review will be concluded with a discussion of the current findings, the implications of these findings and possible directions for future research.

# Embeddedness effects

In the game-theoretic literature, there are two mechanisms through which embeddedness is considered to affect cooperation between actors: *control* and *learning* [e.g., @buskens_raub_handbook_2013; @yamagishi_yamagishi_trust_1994]. Control, which will be the focus of this review, denotes the opportunity to sanction opportunistic behaviour by exerting control over one's partner's long-term returns. Under dyadic embeddedness, one can punish the defection of one's interaction partner in a previous interaction by refraining from cooperation in current and future interactions [i.e., an actor can rely on direct reciprocity; @nowak_evolving_2012]. Additionally, under network embeddedness, one might inform future transaction partners of a defecting actor, who can in turn refuse to cooperate with this actor [which is also called indirect reciprocity; @nowak_evolving_2012; @sigmund_moral_2012]. This mechanism can also be referred to as control through "voice", in the sense of @hirschman_voice_1970. Hence, the short-term benefits of acting opportunistically come with the prospect of future retaliation, hanging over the head of opportunistic actors as the sword of Damocles. Notably, what @buskens_raub_handbook_2013 termed "control" differs from what is called "the illusion of control" in the social psychological literature [e.g., @morris_distinguishing_1998; @hayashi_etal_reciprocity_1999]. Where "control" in the sense of @buskens_raub_handbook_2013 refers to actual sanctioning opportunities, "the illusion of control" concerns the finding that one might act as if it is possible to control the behaviour of one's partner in one-shot games, if one's decision is made prior to the decision of one's partner, even though no information is transferred between the players [@morris_distinguishing_1998]. 

Learning, on the contrary, refers to the situation where the actors involved have interacted in the past, when they are embedded dyadically, and hereby gained information about each others' past behaviour [@buskens_raub_handbook_2013]. If one's partner behaved cooperatively in the past, one may infer that this partner will behave cooperatively again in the current and future transactions. When the actors involved are embedded in a common network, the actors may learn from others how their transaction partners behaved in interactions with third parties. If one's current partner behaved cooperatively during past interactions with third parties, one might infer that the transaction partner will behave cooperatively in the current transaction as well. Obviously, when an actor's partner has abused cooperative behaviour of this actor, or of a third party, the actor may not be willing to take the risk of getting exploited, and defect in the current interaction as well.

A second distinction that can be made relates to the nature of the embeddedness of a transaction. Namely, rather often, researchers decide who will interact with whom in an experiment, a situation that is commonly referred to as *exogenous embeddedness*. However, in real life, people often choose with whom they wish to interact, at least to a certain extent [@chaudhuri_experiments_2009; @yamagishi_prisoners_1994]. Some researchers tried to incorporate this characteristic of real-life encounters in their research by letting participants choose their transaction partners, which is referred to as *endogenous embeddedness*. Overall, it appeared that endogenously formed relations tend to have a larger effect on cooperation rates than exogenously formed relationships [e.g., @chaudhuri_sustaining_2011; @wang_cooperation_2012; @schneider_weber_cooperation_2013; @gurerk_cooperation_2014; @frey_buskens_investments_2019].

The empirical findings that are to be discussed in the next section will be concentrated around the question to what extent control affects cooperation. Hence, the effect of learning, as well as alternative explanations for the emergence of cooperation outside the game-theoretic paradigm such as inequity aversion or altruism [e.g., @fehr_schmidt_fairness_1999; @dreber_etal_altruism_2014; @carpenter_altruism_2008] fall beyond the scope of this review. A distinction will be made between control under dyadic embeddedness and under network embeddedness, as well as between exogenously and endogenously formed relationships. Note that a great deal of the work published in this area has not distinguished between learning and control explicitly, but merely addresses the question how different forms of embeddedness in general affect cooperation. Nevertheless, it is often possible to assess the effect of control, either explicitly or implicitly. In general, there are two ways to disentangle learning and control. The first possibility is to study solely behaviour of participants in the first round of a given game, because then no learning could have taken place. The second way, that is often used to analyse behaviour in finitely repeated games, is to assess the effect of the number of rounds left after controlling for any learning that could have taken place. Specifically, previous actions by an actor's transaction partner are taken into account when analysing the behaviour of an actor in any given round and assessing the effect of the number of rounds to play.

- Add that embeddedness can foster cooperation through two mechanisms: learning and control. 
- Briefly explain learning.
- More elaborately explain control, and remark that this review focuses on control. However, as quite some literature is not able to distinguish learning and control, it is helpful to explain learning as well, so that it is possible to refer back to this section when control and learning cannot be disentangled.
- Explain that control effects can be investigated in experiments looking at the first round of a series of games (no learning yet), by an end-game effect, or by controlling for learning effects. The latter is generally hard, as it is not known how learning and control effects may affect one another.

<!--Ostrom (1997) remarks that providing sanction opportunities against those that abuse trust can increase trust and cooperation. 

S√°nchez (2018) remarks that the mechanism underlying the stability of cooperation in dynamic networks may be rather general, namely, the opportunity to punish misbehaving actors: "When my neighbor defects and benefits from my cooperative action, I punish her by cutting the corresponding link and abstaining from interacting." This allows cooperators to unite themselves and leaving out the actors that abused trust.-->

# Control effects in dyadic relations

Control effects in dyadic relations can be studied in both finitely and infinitely repeated interactions. In finitely repeated interactions, however, it follows from backward induction that, under the assumption of game-theoretic rationality, no cooperation is possible [e.g., @luce_raiffa_games_1989; @selten_chain_1978]. Namely, in the last round of the game, non-cooperative behaviour cannot be punished in any subsequent round, and hence, defecting always yields a higher payoff than cooperation. As actors decided to defect in the final round, actions in the penultimate round do not affect behaviour in the last round, and again defection is the payoff maximizing strategy. This pattern repeats itself to the first round of the game, and hence, under the assumption of rationality, no cooperation is possible in any round of the game. A wide variety of experiments however showed that subjects act cooperatively in initial rounds, leading Rapoport [-@rapoport_order_1997, 122] to conclude that in practice, subjects do not rely on, or are not capable of backward induction. 

@kreps_et_al_rational_1982 proved that even populations of rational actors could maintain high levels of cooperation, under the assumption that these rational actors belief with sufficiently high probability that their transaction partners have no incentive to defect, until their partners are defected on themselves. If the rational actors believe that the probability to meet such a conditional cooperator is high enough, the benefits of mutual cooperation outweigh the gains of exploiting a conditional cooperator once in an early round and being punished with defection thereafter. The prospect of mutual cooperation directly allows for the introduction of control [@buskens_raub_handbook_2013]. Namely, after an actor defects, it is immediately known to the other player that the defecting actor is not a conditional cooperator, and the finitely repeated game would be one of mutual defection hereafter if the players are rational. Yet, as long as both players cooperate, it is not known whether any of the two players is a conditional cooperator. The actors can thus control one another, because future payoffs depend on one's behaviour in the current round. In the final rounds of the finitely repeated game however, the long term benefits of mutual cooperation may no longer outweigh the short-term costs of maintaining one's reputation (i.e., the opportunities to control future behaviour of one another diminish), and hence rational actors will try to exploit their partners in these rounds.

In infinitely, or indefinitely, repeated games, there is no end-game effect, as there is no predetermined final round. Namely, a game will be played for another round with a certain continuation probability $\delta$, which @axelrod_cooperation_1984 aptly termed the "shadow of the future", and end with probability $(1-\delta)$. In these games, cooperation can supported in equilibrium if the continuation probability is large enough [see e.g. @buskens_raub_handbook_2013 for the technical details]. Comparing cooperation rates in the first round of an infinitely repeated game to cooperation rates <!--in the first round of a finitely repeated game or-->in a one-shot game or in games with a different continuation probability <!--(i.e., a finitely repeated game of length one) -->allows to assess the effect of control. Namely, in a one-shot game, there is no possibility to sanction opportunistic behaviour, and thus there is no control, while in repeated games with different continuation probabilities, the control opportunities differ as well. <!--In a finitely repeated game of the same expected length as an infinitely repeated game, there are fewer control opportunities, because in the final round of a finitely repeated game, no control is possible.--> Although the analysis of first round behaviour is merely a practical issue, that is, due to the continuation probability $\delta$ there is no guarantee that a second round will be played, it is beneficial to disentangle learning and control. Namely, in the first round of a finitely repeated game, no learning can have occurred yet.

## Control in exogenously dyadically embedded interactions (repeated games)

In exogenously formed finitely repeated games, one can generally observe a pattern of high cooperation in the initial rounds of a finitely repeated game, with a sharp decrease in cooperation toward the end of the game [e.g., @buskens_raub_veer_triads_2010; @miltenburg_buskens_triads_2012; @embrey_etal_cooperation_2018; @mao_resilient_cooperators_2017]. However, this decline in cooperation cannot entirely be ascribed to the lack of control opportunities in the final rounds of the game. Participants may namely refrain from cooperation for three different reasons. First, defection could be a response to defection of one's partner in an earlier rounds. Second, an actor may have learned in previous games that in the final rounds of the repeated game, hardly any cooperation is possible, and hence defecting serves as a protection against being exploited. Third, an actor may realize that the short-term benefits of defecting outweigh the possible returns of another round of mutual cooperation.

@buskens_raub_veer_triads_2010 explicitly study the presence of control effects in a Trust Game, which slightly changes the nature of the game relative to a Prisoner's Dilemma. Rather than mutually risking possible exploitation, in the Trust Game only the trustor, who decides whether or not to trust the trustee, risks being exploited. The trustee on the other hand, has to decide whether to honour or abuse trust, if trust is placed, but cannot choose between these options if no trust is placed. Hence, the possible actions of the trustee depend on the initial choice of the trustor. Under dyadic embeddedness, @buskens_raub_veer_triads_2010 find that after controlling for learning effects, there is a positive effect of the number of rounds still to be played (i.e., control opportunities) on cooperation, for both the trustor and the trustee. Additionally, these authors study the effect of dyadic embeddedness when the dyadic relation is embedded in a small network, where two trustors are in a relationship with a single trustee (i.e., a triad). In this network, information can be exchanged between the first trustor and the second trustor, and hence, the trustors can learn about the trustee not only from their own game with the trustee, but also from the game of the other trustor in the triad with the same trustee. Also in this condition, the number of rounds that has to be played between a trustor and a trustee is positively related to cooperation for both trustor, and trustee, after controlling for learning effects in terms of past moves of the trustee in the game with the trustor at hand, as well as in terms of past moves of the trustee in the game with the other trustor.

Other studies corroborate the finding that the number of rounds that are to be played affect cooperation rates. @embrey_etal_cooperation_2018 performs a meta-study with data from multiple previously held experiments on finitely repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games by @andreoni_miller_cooperation_1993, @dal_b√≥_cooperation_2005, @cooper_et_al_cooperation_1996, @bereby_roth_cooperation_2006 and @friedman_oprea_continuous_2012. The combined evidence from these studies and a newly designed experiment, show that first round cooperation rates, where no learning could have occurred, increases with the length of the game. Additionally, @miltenburg_buskens_triads_2012 shows that dyadically embedded actors learn to play cooperatively in initial rounds of a finitely repeated Trust Game of fifteen rounds, with near perfect cooperation in the first round of later played games that remains above 80% until the twelfth round, but decreases to negligible levels shortly hereafter. However, no explicit distinction between learning and control effects is made in the analyses. @mao_resilient_cooperators_2017 make the same observation that people learn to play cooperatively in early rounds of a finitely repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game, with near perfect cooperation in the first round that remains above 80% but decreases to negligible levels in the final two rounds, although again no explicit distinction between control and learning effects is made. Remarkably, this experiment is repeated on twenty consecutive days, with twenty 10-round games per day, and shows that this pattern keeps repeating itself throughout the study period, regardless of the fact that actors experience that in final rounds cooperation seldom prevails.

Research into cooperation in infinitely repeated games was initiated by @roth_murnighan_1978 and @murnighan_roth_1983, who found on average somewhat higher cooperation rates under a high continuation probability relative to under low continuation probabilities. However, this increase was generally small, leading the authors to conclude that the introduction of infinitely repeated interactions hardly fosters cooperation. However, these authors let the participants play against the experimenters, rather than against each other. Additionally, these studies did not translate the amount of points participants earned during the experiment linearly to a monetary reward, which potentially affects the incentives of the subjects to strive for a higher number of points. @dal_b√≥_cooperation_2005 improves upon this initial work in infinitely repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games, and finds significant differences between three continuation probabilities (i.e., $\delta = 0, 1/2, 3/4$), such that first round cooperation rates increase with the continuation probability. Particularly, the differences become larger with the experience participants gained. Hence, the prospect of future benefits through mutual cooperation and the fear of missing out on these benefits after initiating defection seem to result in a higher willingness to cooperate.

Similar observations were made by @dal_b√≥_fr√©chette_evolution_2011 and @dal_b√≥_fr√©chette_determinants_2018. These authors argue that the limited effect of increasing the continuation probability in earlier studies is due to the fact that participants have to gain experience to properly evaluate the effect of this increase. With sufficient experience, participants generally cooperate when cooperation can be supported in equilibrium, and defect when it cannot. Moreover, cooperation rates in first rounds of infinitely repeated games are systematically higher than cooperation rates in the first rounds of finitely repeated games of the same expected length, especially after the subjects have gained experience with the game they play [@dal_b√≥_cooperation_2005; @dal_b√≥_fr√©chette_evolution_2011; @dal_b√≥_fr√©chette_determinants_2018]. Namely, in the finitely repeated games, in earlier games the subjects experienced that cooperation will be abused in the final round of the game, and protect themselves against this behaviour by defecting in an earlier stage already. No such behaviour is present in infinitely repeated games; in fact, the cooperation rates tend to increase with the experience of the participants. Notably, because the defecting behaviour of most participants in final rounds of a finitely repeated game implies that future sanctions for behaviour in the penultimate round are not credible, subjects experience less control opportunities in finitely repeated games relative to infinitely repeated games of the same expected length. Consequently, first round cooperation in finitely repeated games may decrease, due to this reason.

Although the evidence consistently shows that first round cooperation increases with the (expected) number of rounds left, there remains substantial heterogeneity in cooperation rates, even in games of approximately the same length. Whereas @cooper_et_al_cooperation_1996 find cooperation rates in finitely repeated games of around 65%, @embrey_etal_cooperation_2018 find above 80% cooperation and @mao_resilient_cooperators_2017 observes near perfect cooperation, all in the first round, even though all games have a fixed end at round 10 and differences in the payoff matrix are only minor. Differences in economic incentives, however, are likely to affect this difference. In the study by @cooper_et_al_cooperation_1996, only relative payoffs were important, as the player with the highest number of points in each game received a monetary payoff of $\$1$ at the end of each game, while the losing partner received nothing. In @embrey_etal_cooperation_2018 and @mao_resilient_cooperators_2017, players' monetary payoffs were linearly derived from the number of points they gathered, neglecting relative standings and emphasizing the importance of receiving a high number of points.


## Control in endogenously dyadically embedded interactions (repeated games)

The previous section shows that in exogenously embedded dyadic interactions there is a relatively consistent effect of control on cooperation. However, a substantial portion of real-life interactions, dyadic embeddedness is not imposed exogenously, but rather established intentionally by the actors involved [@kollock_emergence_1994]. Dyadic embeddedness also fosters first-round cooperation when it is chosen by the actors involved in an interaction, without having prior information with respect to the subsequent transaction partner [@sokolova_buskens_cooperation_2021; @schneider_weber_cooperation_2013; @brown_etal_relational_2004]. These findings are in line with the idea that actors realize that having a good reputation may facilitate future lucrative interactions [@kollock_emergence_1994], and that such a reputation can be build by behaving cooperatively. In fact, even at the cost of a portion of subjects' payoffs, they are willing to establish a long-term relationship, and are subsequently more likely to behave cooperatively in this relationship compared to behaviour in one-shot games [@sokolova_buskens_cooperation_2021]. 

When dyadic embeddedness is established endogenously, however, not necessarily the effect of control induces more cooperation, as there might also be a selection effect at work. Then, people who are more willing to cooperate are more likely to engage in repeated interactions, and hence cooperation in repeated interactions is higher. @schneider_weber_cooperation_2013 show that people who *a priori* indicate a higher willingness to cooperate were indeed more likely to engage in repeated interactions, although this characteristic only explained part of the increase in first round cooperation rates relative to one-shot games. Again, it was shown, however, that a longer, endogenously chosen, duration yields more first round cooperation, similarly to the findings under exogenous dyadic embeddedness [@schneider_weber_cooperation_2013], which is indicative for a control effect. Additionally, @brown_etal_relational_2004 find that, already in the first round, actors are more trustful and trustworthy when the possibility of endogenously chosen repeated interactions exist, relative to when continuing an interaction is not possible, regardless of whether an interaction is indeed continued. Note that in this experiment, actors are randomly assigned to a treatment where endogenously chosen repeated interactions are possible or a treatment when such interactions are not possible. Hence, the prospect of a mutually cooperative interaction already induces more cooperation. Although systematic testing of the effect of control on cooperation in endogenous dyadic embedded interactions is, to the best of my knowledge, fairly limited, the available evidence suggests that it likely is at least as strong as in exogenously dyadic embedded interactions.

[Potentially add a section containing the studies by Schuessler (1989), Jin, Hayashi & Shinotsuka (1993), Hauk & Nagel (2001), Hauk (2003) and Zhang, Fan, Li, Zheng, Bao, Cressman, & Tao (2016), who additionally consider opting out of a repeated interaction. For now I focused on network embeddedness first, but given that there are still three weeks left, I might add this. At first, I thought that these experiments concerned dyadic embeddedness, because interacting actors obtain information only about there own interactions with a given partner and not about interactions by any other player, and also do not build any kind of reputation through which sanctions by third parties can be implemented. Yet, in Werner's farewell lecture I saw that this is discussed as a part of network embeddedness, because the actor's are embedded in a network in the sense that after being defected, they can approach a new transaction partner that "shares" the common network. Yet, I had the impression that sanctions were implemented dyadically, because defecting actors are left by an actor willing to cooperate.]


# Control effects of network embeddedness

In the previous section, it is shown that in a wide variety of research settings, the potential to engage in future interactions with a given partner drastically improves cooperation rates. However, this research deliberately ignores an important factor that characterizes many real-life interactions: the involvement of third-parties [@granovetter_economic_1985]. Even if an actor does not engage in a long-term relationship with the same partner, the behaviour of this actor may have consequences for future interactions, albeit with different partners [@buskens_raub_embedded_2002]. If reliable information on an actor's behaviour spread through a network, a rational actor may be more inclined to behave cooperatively, because failing to do so would provide others with good reasons to refrain from cooperating, negatively affecting one's future returns. A rational actor would foresee that defecting in a given game may have severe drawbacks during later interactions, and hence will be more inclined to cooperate. That is, the actor can be *controlled*, due to the prospect of future interactions. Note however that making assumptions on the flow of reliable information about actors' behaviour may be problematic, as actors may face strategic incentives to share misleading information, and whether or not share information on someone's behaviour is itself a (second-order) social dilemma. These difficulties are generally ignored in research on network embeddedness. 

Similarly to dyadic embeddedness, control effects under network embeddedness can be studied in finitely as well as in infinitely repeated games, where actors are matched exogenously or endogenously. Theoretical contributions showed that in an infinitely repeated game setting, a higher expected number of interactions and a faster flow of information (i.e., a denser network) render cooperation more likely [@raub_weesie_reputation_1990; @buskens_weesie_cooperation_2000]. Yet, most experimental studies on network embeddedness employ a finitely repeated game design. @buskens_trust_2003 developed a theoretical model that closely resembles the model by @kreps_et_al_rational_1982, including the assumption that actors belief with sufficiently large probability that some trustees will not abuse trust, but concerns interacting triads in which two trustors and one trustee play finitely repeated Trust Games. Although the model concerns a small network, the conclusion that network embeddedness fosters cooperation still holds. All these models rely on the idea that reliable information on misbehaving actors spread through the network, providing others with good reasons to refrain from cooperating with a defecting actor. 

## Control in exogenously embedded interactions in networks

Whereas dyadic embeddedness generally leads to substantial higher cooperation rates due to control effects relative to atomized interactions, the effects of network embeddedness seem at best mixed. @corten_etal_reputation_2016 finds that having information about all interactions in a network of six actors does not improve cooperation rates among randomly matched actors at all, relative to a condition where subjects are only provided information on their own interactions. Even though no explicit distinction between control and learning is made, cooperation in initial rounds of the game is also not higher under network embeddedness. If there was an effect of network embeddedness on cooperation at all, this effect was more towards the negative side. Similar observations were made by @barrera_buskens_third_2009, although here network embeddedness was studied relative to dyadic embeddedness in Investment Games played in triads with a focus on the behaviour of trustors. Especially the trustors do not seem to realize that network embeddedness allows for more severe punishments if trust is abused. 

More rigorous testing on the effects of control under exogenous network embeddedness has been done by @buskens_raub_veer_triads_2010, who study Trust Games in triads. The authors find no statistically significant effect of exogenous network control on trustfulness of the trustors, although first round trustfulness rates are somewhat higher under network embeddedness. Studies by @miltenburg_buskens_triads_2012 and @frey_buskens_investments_2019 observe similar behaviour of trustors, although no explicit tests of control effects were made. Hence, trustors seem to have difficulties with realizing that sanction opportunities accumulate as there are additional trustors involved that can punish untrustworthy behaviour. Trustees, however, seem to clearly realize that sanctioning under network embeddedness may be more harmful than under dyadic embeddedness. @buskens_raub_veer_triads_2010 find significant network control effects on the trustworthiness of the trustee, while @frey_buskens_investments_2019 graphically show that first-round trustworthiness increases under exogenous network embeddedness. @miltenburg_buskens_triads_2012 does not seem to show any effects of network control, but in this study dyadic embeddedness on itself already resulted in rates of trustworthiness mainly above 0.80 until the last two rounds, after subjects gained experience. Hence, when network embeddedness was established exogenously, it hardly seemed to affect cooperation rates.


## Control in endogenously embedded interactions in networks

Besides network control effects under exogenously embedded interactions, network control effects can be assessed under endogenously embedded interactions. Yet, relatively few studies assessed cooperation under endogenously established network embeddedness in two-person dilemmas. In fact, to the best of my knowledge, no studies exist that explicitly test control effects in these settings. However, some studies exist that allow to get an initial grasp of control effects under endogenously established network embeddedness. @frey_buskens_investments_2019 do study the effect of endogenous network embeddedness on cooperation in addition to (exogenous) dyadic embeddedness in Trust Games. Both network embeddedness established by the trustors, as well as network embeddedness established by the trustee, positively affects first-round trustfulness and trustworthiness rates, although no statistical test for this effect was performed. These choices likely represent the fact that these trustors and trustees understand the perks of embeddedness for establishing a cooperative relation. However, as either trustors or trustees had to invest a portion of their payoffs to establish embeddedness, there is likely to be a selection effect as well. Namely, the willingness to invest may signal once willingness to establish a cooperative relationship.

@corten_buskens_cooperation_2020, who studies the effect of dynamic networks of six actors on cooperation rates finds no support for an effect of network embeddedness, and hence no indication for a control effect. Note that in this study actors chose to engage in an interaction, and hence cooperation rates where defined as a proportion of the total number of games. When cooperation is assessed relative to the total number of interactions, cooperation was somewhat higher when actors received information about their partners through their network connections, relative to when people only gathered information through their own interactions, although the effect of network control was not specifically assessed. Additionally, @wang_cooperation_2012 shows that in $N$-person Prisoner's Dilemma games with dynamic partner updating, cooperation starts at higher levels than in fixed networks. In these interactions, actors can repeatedly select and deselect network members, resulting in the fact that having a poor reputation may result in ending up without (cooperative) interaction partners. Actors seem to realize this, and tend to start cooperatively, but start to defect in later stages.

Overall, it appears that the findings on the effects of control through network embeddedness are, at best, mixed. Although some studies show some indication of control effects through network embeddedness, most studies do not find such effects. When control effects were found, it mainly affected those actors that were in the position to abuse trust (i.e., both players can abuse trust in a Prisoner's Dilemma game, but only trustees can abuse trust in a Trust Game).  The positive effects of network embeddedness that are found seem to be more due to assortment than due to control. That is, cooperative actors may signal a willingness to cooperate, while actors that do not intend to cooperate do not. Additionally, when ties with actors that abuse trust can be easily abandoned, cooperative relationships seem to occur more frequently. An exception to this finding is the study by @corten_buskens_cooperation_2020. However, cooperation is often vulnerable, and an initial pattern of actors that try to exploit each other may easily result in a collapse of cooperation [@kollock_emergence_1994]. In such situations, the effect of experience may be particularly important. Ample studies show that initial games may fail to reach cooperative relationships, even though cooperation can be supported in equilibrium [e.g., @miltenburg_buskens_triads_2012; @dal_b√≥_cooperation_2005; @dal_b√≥_fr√©chette_evolution_2011]. However, as subjects gain experience, cooperation may reach high levels, when it can be supported in equilibrium. 


<!--
@wang_cooperation_2012 shows that in N-person prisoner's dilemma games with dynamic partner updating, cooperation levels start significantly higher than in fixed networks, possibly because reputation in these treatments is even more important. That is, ill-behaving actors can be punished by being denied a transaction partner in future rounds, reducing an actor's returns. "The results suggest that observed assortativity derived less from cooperators "punishing" defectors by deleting ties, but more from two related mechanisms: (i) cooperators avoiding defectors and (ii) defectors failing to propose links to cooperators. Not really an article about control.
<!--Cooperation rates may increase more due to endogenously established network embeddedness, due to the fact that establishing such a form of embeddedness may "signal" that an actor is willing to engage in a cooperative relationship. In one-shot games, it is shown that actors who are willing to engage in a transaction are more likely to behave cooperatively [@orbell_dawes_social_1993], and also in dyadically embedded games, it can be seen that endogenously chosen dyadic embeddedness can foster cooperation [e.g., @schneider_weber_cooperation_2013]. Another factor that possibly affects cooperation in interactions that are endogenously embedded in networks is that sanctioning does not necessarily affect one's own payoffs. Hence, the costs of sanctioning are attenuated if one can abandon an unfruitful relationship for-->

@corten_etal_reputation_2016 remarks "stable and slowly changing social network structures do not improve cooperation; only when subjects are allowed to change interaction partners frequently, cooperation is higher (Rand et al.; Riedl & Ule). When subjects are informed about the actions o fall other subjects, cooperation emerges more consistently [41, 42]. Ahn et al. [45] study reputation effects on dyadic PDs in a dynamic network context, in the sense that subjects may have the opportunity to choose their interaction partners. In this context, reputation effects enhance cooperation. 

<!--The experiment performed by @corten_etal_reputation_2016 also does not reveal any effect of network control effects on cooperation. In fact, cooperation in the first rounds of the embedded condition yields somewhat lower cooperation rates than under atomized conditions. However, all these studies hardly allow for gaining experience. In studies on dyadic embeddedness, the importance of experience for playing social dilemma games became apparent [see dal bo, dal bo & frechette, miltenburg et al]. Especially as games become more complex, subjects seem to need time to grasp the dynamics of the games they play, and adapt their behavior more towards equilibrium behavior as their experience increases.-->

@corten_buskens_cooperation_2020: "Experimental results suggest at best limited effects of network structure on cooperation in static networks (e.g., Cassar, 2007; Corten et al., 2016; Grazia-L√°zaro et al., 2012; Grujic et al., 2010; Kirchkamp & Nagel, 2007; Rand et al., 2014; S√°nchez, 2018), while dynamic networks seem to be more succesful in sustaining cooperation (rand et al., 2011). Note that in these experiments, subjects played $N$-person PDs. Recently, Harrell et al. (2018) confirmed the positive effect of reputation for the situation where subjects play several 2-person PDs in a partially static network where some of the ties can be changed."

<!--
@buskens_raub_veer_triads_2010 find a clear dyadic control effect on trustfulness, although no network control effect is found. For trustworthiness, the authors do find a network control effect. @miltenburg_buskens_triads_2012 provide some preliminary evidence for a similar claim by means of graphical results, but do not provide statistical results for such claims.-->
<!--
@frey_buskens_investments_2019 study endogenous and exogenous network embeddedness in addition to dyadic embeddedness versus dyadic embeddedness in triads who repeatedly play a trust game. The authors distinguish between endogenous network embeddedness chosen by two trustors independently and endogenous network embeddedness chosen by the trustee, both at a cost to the respective actors. Although control effects were not studied explicitly, the provided figures give an indication of first round cooperation rates under varying embeddedness conditions. <!--It is shown that first round trustfulness is hardly affected by exogenously established network embeddedness, while trustworthiness is higher in this condition, both relative to a control condition with only dyadic embeddedness.--> 

<!--
Research on repeated interactions under dyadic embeddedness involves two actors forced into a relation with an endogenously or exogenously chosen interaction time. However, in reality, interaction partners may deliberately choose to engage in a relationship [@yamagishi_prisoners_1994; @kollock_emergence_1994]. -->
<!--
@sanchez_physics_2018 remarks in a review that lattices or networks do not support cooperation at all. Even though cooperation in networks generally starts at a high level, with the majority of the actors choosing to cooperate, cooperation rates generally decrease to a fraction of only 20%. Also, he remarks that people do not take into account the earnings of their neighbours. Even though actors might be mimicking others, this mimicking is not based on others' payoffs. When subjects can choose their transaction partners endogenously, rather than being forced into a network, stable cooperation can prevail. However, in these circumstances, cooperation is not due to learning or control, but due to assortment. Cooperators unite and leave those that defected [this was mentioned as the only true reason supporting cooperation in 45]. "In the case of cooperation on structured populations, it appears that information on the others' behaviour (i.e., reputation), is the mediator for the choices in whom to connect with [40], although @corten_etal_reputation_2016 found that reputation does not always help.

Possible reason for the breakdown of trust: initial behaviour has an important influence on the emergence of cooperation. @kollock_emergence_1994 remarks that "... the market 'failed' in that after a short length of time only low-quality goods were being sold at low prices (and so resulting in low profits for everyone). ... in the group where the first few moves were exploitative (trying to get a high price for low-quality goods), low_quality goods were soon the only ones available in the group."

# Implications for future research

In the simplest interactions, that is, one-shot interactions in a social vacuum, high levels of cooperation can hardly be sustained if games are repeated [@simpson_willer_beyond_2015]. In this review, it became apparent that embeddedness can foster cooperation between actors due to the possibility to control future payoffs of one's interaction partner. The available evidence rather consistently shows that more control opportunities induce more cooperation. Although the introduction of embeddedness narrows the gap to real-life interactions, an overwhelming amount of the experiments conducted remains rather artificial in nature. This approach has clear advantages, as it allows to separate the slightest sources of variation that would be entangled in survey research and to assess the causal effect of changing certain features of an interaction on cooperation. However, these artificial experiments do little in explaining why humans behave as they behave in real-life encounters, as it is hardly assessed how taking people out of their social context affects their behaviour.

Axelrod Launching ‚ÄòThe Evolution of Cooperation‚Äô - "There were several limitations in using people - even skilled people - to study how to best play the Prisoner's Dilemma. 

Why does dyadic embeddedness foster cooperation more than network embeddedness. @sigmund_moral_2012 argues that under network embeddedness, many players seem to rely on first-order assessment. That is, actors base their decision to cooperate on the observed cooperativeness of their transaction partners in the past. While this assessment rule might work under dyadic embeddedness, where the reason of one's partner's action can be inferred, it does not do well under network embeddedness. However, tracking whether one's partner's past behaviour against third parties were the result earlier defections against this partner is generally difficult [@milinski_cooperation_2001 is referred that higher order assessment is cognitively taxing].

@kollock_emergence_1994 on experiments: "[T]he typical social exchange experiment guarantees the terms of exchange. In one sense this is an understandable feature of an experimental paradigm if one wishes to study, for example, the dynamics of power in a controlled way, but in another sense it sidesteps much that is crucial in actual interaction (concerns of uncertainty, risk, and being taken advantage of) and thus much that may be central in explaining why social structure in the form of networks of commitment exists.

Most studies in this field of research are narrowed down to assess how small changes in conditions affect cooperation, providing insight in multiple potentially important mechanisms that affect cooperation. This has led to a wide variety of factors that in one way or another affect cooperation when studied in isolation. A numerous amount of studies focused on cooperation in dyadically embedded relations, formed either exogenously or endogenously, to investigate what aspects of an interaction may foster and complicate cooperation. Additionally, there are numerous studies that assess how network embeddedness fosters cooperation, most of them focusing on a relatively small aspect of the network. However, these studies suffer from two important limitations. First, most experiments rely on an artificial and often greatly simplified social context, regardless of whether the focus of the studies is dyadic or network embeddedness. Hence, the extent to which findings from these experiments can be translated to everyday life is often questionable. Second, focusing on relatively small changes between conditions may complicate an assessment of the bigger picture. Predominantly, factors that seem important for cooperation when studied in isolation, may appear trivial when multiple factors are assessed simultaneously. 

The majority of experimental studies on dyadic embeddedness do not allow for leaving a defective relationship, with @brown_etal_relational_2004 as one of the rare exceptions. See also Hauk (2003; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1027385819400.pdf) Yet, this feature is often covered in studies on network embeddedness. See e.g. Buskens 2003 for a theoretical outline of the effect of leaving opportunities.

Most research on embeddedness assesses how different relations between actors, that is, dyadic versus through third parties and exogenous versus endogenous affects cooperation. However, in a substantial proportion of this research, the mechanisms that promote cooperation remain relatively implicit. Hence, it becomes clear that certain manipulations affect cooperative behavior, but not why exactly these manipulations work, or, alternatively, what aspects of these manipulations make these changes come about. 

Rand (2012) from Nowok - Evolving cooperation (2012) suggests that online labor markets such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk provide a useful platform for conducting behavioural experiments.

<!--However, the question is whether it is actually control that fosters cooperation in repeated interactions. Namely, the prospect of future benefits that by far outweigh the gains of short-term opportunistic behaviour can possibly be realized without any control. Consider a game in which after the end of every round, the subjects involved unilaterally decide to break of the interaction. That is, the subjects play a one-shot game, and after the game, they can decide whether they want to play the same game with each other. There is no control in a strict sense, because future interactions depend on choices made after the game. However,-->

# Conclusion

Obviously, there are other explanations possible that allow to explain cooperative behavior, such as relaxing assumptions on the rationality and selfishness of individuals. However, this review deliberately aims to focus on the effect of embeddedness, and in particular on control, to explain cooperative behaviour. 
<!--
In these studies, causality is generally not an issue. The majority of the reviewed literature makes use of the experimental method, that allows the researcher to attribute changes in the outcome to the varying conditions. In this way, experimental research overcomes some of the difficulties of non-experimental field data that is typically difficult to replicate and does seldom allow for causal inference [fehr_gintis_2007; ADD BIBTEX]. The primary problem of this line of research lies in the external validity of the results. The fact that theories prove their usefulness in a laboratory does not necessarily say much about these mechanisms in the real world. 

Additionally, most experimental work has a hard time identifying the mechanism through which cooperation occurs. There is (???) evidence for the effect of control, but these effects are often hard to tell apart from direct sanctioning or learning models.

## Experiment idea

To test the notion of network embeddedness in comparison to dyadic embeddedness, one can employ the following design. Players are randomly allocated to a network of X players, with X somewhere between 4 to 6. In this network, they play games with a randomly drawn other in every round, with certain continuation probability $p$ that there is a subsequent round after the round that is currently played, with $p$ for example 3/4.

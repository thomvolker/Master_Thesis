Only laboratory experiment in which both dyadic and network embeddedness were manipulated in Trust Games in similar ways to the triadic repeated Trust Game article by Buskens, Raub and Van der Veer. This experiment however involves a more complex setting in which trustors play simultaneously rather than sequentially with one trustee, which affects the predictions.
